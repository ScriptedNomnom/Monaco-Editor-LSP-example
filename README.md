# Monaco Lua Example

An example setup using sumneko's [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/) and JohnnyMorganz's [StyLua](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua) together with [Monaco Editor](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor).

If you use linux or mac, please go to launch.ts under the src inside server folder and you see this:
- resolve(process.cwd(), 'lua-language-server/.bin/Windows/lua-language-server')
Please change Windows to others like "Mac" or "Linux" depending on what os you use.

## Features

- ‚ú® Syntax Highlighting
- üöÄ Autocompletion
- üåù EmmyLua
- ‚úîÔ∏è Linting
- ü¶Ä Formatting (via wasm)
- ‚ö° Vite based client

## Info

- Right now I've tested the lua language server only on linux.
- The language server uses port `8080`, so make sure this port is free or change the port in `client/src/main.ts` and `server/src/main.ts`
- This is an npm workspaces setup, so you can run alle npm scripts inside the repository's root folder.

## Get started

Clone this repository and run run `npm install`.

## Development

Run `npm run dev` and visit `localhost:3000`.

## Production

Run `npm run build`. To start the language server run `npm run server-start`.
